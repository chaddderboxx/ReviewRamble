                <p>The goal of this project is to provide a space where people
                    can comment and review comments and ratings about shoes.
                    Specifically, the goal of this project is to create a space
                    that will allow a user to have information about the consumer’s 
                    experience with purchased shoes.   
                    In the future that user may be compensated economically based 
                    on other people’s comments and likes.
